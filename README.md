# SDC Infra Team Issues Repository

This repository is currently used primarily by Infra Team members to document and track technical issues and their solutions through **Issues**. There is no formal planning or documentation for the repository itself yet. The main technical documentation is stored in the **SDC Notion** **Infrastructure Teamspace**.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Issue Submission and Tracking**:
   - When you encounter technical issues or challenges in your daily work, please detail your problem in **Issues**.
   - Document the solutions you've tried, even if the issue remains unresolved, to help other members provide assistance quickly.
   - Once the issue is resolved, update the Issue with the final solution so that others can benefit from your experience.

2. **Unplanned Documentation**:
   - While there is no formal documentation planning for this repository yet, most of the technical information and guidance can be found in **SDC Notion**'s **Infrastructure Teamspace**.
   - As the repository evolves, we may introduce more structured documentation here.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Use Issues to Document Problems**: Ensure that enough detailed information is recorded in Issues so that other members can understand the context of the problem.
2. **Solution Updates**: Once the problem is resolved, make sure to update the Issue with your solution so that other members can benefit from it.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions, use **Issues** to communicate with Infra Team members or refer to **SDC Notion's** **Infrastructure Teamspace** for relevant information.
